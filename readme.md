# Laravel Server Monitor

Laravel package to periodically monitor the health of your server and application. It ships with common checks out of the box and allows you to add your own custom checks too. The packages comes with both console and web interfaces.

## Requirements

 - PHP >= 8+
 - Laravel 9

## Installation

``` bash
$ composer require sarfraznawaz2005/servermonitor
```

---

Now publish package's config file by running below command:

```bash
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\ServiceProvider"
```

See `config/server-monitor.php` config file to customize checks, notifications and more.

## Built-in Checks

The package comes with following checks out of the box. Checks can be divided into three categories:

 - **Server Checks:** Checks that are related to your server only.
 - **Common Checks:** Checks that are related to your application only but are common in nature irrespective of which environment your application is running on. These checks run on all environments.
 - **Environment Checks:** Checks that are related to your application only but are limited to specific environment such as production or development.

**Server Checks**

 - :white_check_mark:  Required PHP extensions are installed
 - :white_check_mark:  Disk Space Enough
 - :white_check_mark:  Average CPU Usage
 - :white_check_mark:  FTP Connection Works

 - :white_check_mark:  SSL Certificate Valid
 - :white_check_mark:  Are servers pingable
 - :white_check_mark:  Check HTTP Status Code
 - :white_check_mark:  Check php.ini file values

**Common Checks**

 - :white_check_mark:  Correct Directory Permissions

 - :white_check_mark:  Routes Cache OFF

**Environment Checks (Production)**

 - :white_check_mark:  Debug Mode OFF
 - :white_check_mark:  Config Cache ON

 - :white_check_mark:  Supervisor programs are running

## Commands

The package comes with two commands:

 - `php artisan servermonitor:check` Runs all checks enabled in config file and return their new status.
 - `php artisan servermonitor:status` Returns previously-run status of all checks without running new process.

Here is how it looks:

![Screen 3](https://github.com/sarfraznawaz2005/servermonitor/blob/master/screen3.gif?raw=true)


Both commands take optional argument. If specified, it will run check or return status of only specified check:

 - `php artisan servermonitor:check AppKeySet` Runs new check process for check `AppKeySet`
 - `php artisan servermonitor:status AppKeySet` Returns previous run status for check `AppKeySet`


## Scheduling

You can use `servermonitor:check` command to check status of enabled checks periodically instead of running this command manually each time.

Schedule it in Laravel's console kernel file accordingly:

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
   $schedule->command('servermonitor:check')->hourly();
}
```

## Web Interface

The package provides built-in web interface. You can customize the route of web interface in config file `'route' => 'servermonitor'`. Once done, you can visit Web Interface at url `http://yourapp.com/servermonitor`. Replace `servermonitor` with route you used.

Other than commands, you can also use Web Interface to run new checks process for all or individual checks.

![Screen 2](https://github.com/sarfraznawaz2005/servermonitor/blob/master/screen2.gif?raw=true)

**Disabling Web Interface**

If you would like to disable Web Interface, you can set `web_interface_enabled` to `false` and now hitting web interface route would result in 404.

**Running/Getting Checks Programmatically**

If you still would like to show status of various checks in your view in your own way, you can get status of all checks programmatically like so:

```php
use Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\ServerMonitor;

$sm = new ServerMonitor();
$checkResults = $sm->getChecks();
dump($checkResults);
```

You can also run check(s) programmatically (`$sm->runChecks()`), see available methods in file: `vendor/Sarfraznawaz2005/ServerMonitor/src/ServerMonitor.php`

**Running Checks for Web Only**

If for some reasons, you want to run some checks manually and via Web Interface only, you can specify `web_only` option for such checks like this:

````php
\Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\Checks\Server\RequiredPhpExtensionsAreInstalled::class => [
    'web_only' => true
],
````

Now above check will not be run via console when `servermonitor:check` is run. However this check will be performed when you run all checks via Web Interface.

# Customization

See `config/server-monitor.php` file for all checks. Note that some checks are commented intentionally, you can un-comment them if you need to use them.

You can also customize check name that displays up in console/web interface by passing `name` config value like this:

````php
\Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\Checks\Application\AppKeySet::class => [
    'name' => 'Check if APP_KEY is set',
],
````

If you don't pass `name` key, it will be made out of class name, in above case `App Key Set` by automatically converting "PascalCase" to "Pascal Case" from class name.

Some checks may require additional config options such as:

````php
\Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\Checks\Application\ComposerDependenciesUpToDate::class => [
    'binary_path' => 'composer'
],
````

For above check to work, you must provide `binary_path` value for example.

## Alert Configuration

You can get notified ***when a check fails***. Package supports these alert/notification channels: 

 - `mail`
 - `log`
 - `slack`
 - `pushover`

Update your notification options under `notifications` option in config file.

Note that you can also customize all notification options for individual checks too. Let's say you have specified `mail` as default channel for your alerts but for following check only, it will be alerted via `log` channel and a different alert title:

````php
\Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\Checks\Application\AppKeySet::class => [
    'notification_channel' => 'log',
    'notification_title' => 'Hello World'
]
````

You can also disable alerts for individual checks like so:

````php
\Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\Checks\Application\AppKeySet::class => [
    'disable_notification' => true
]
````

## Creating Your Own Custom Checks

You can create custom checks, by implementing the [`Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\Checks\Check`] interface and adding the class to the config file. Example:

````php
use Sarfraznawaz2005\ServerMonitor\Checks\Check;

class MyCheck implements Check
{
    /**
     * Perform the actual verification of this check.
     *
     * @param array $config
     * @return bool
     */
    public function check(array $config): bool
    {
        return 1 === 1;
    }

    /**
     * The error message to display in case the check does not pass.
     *
     * @return string
     */
    public function message(): string
    {
        return "This error message that users see if check returns false.";
    }
}
````
